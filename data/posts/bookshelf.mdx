# Bookshelf

### Updated March 2023

<br></br>

I sometimes post books recommendation (inspired by [Patric Collison](https://patrickcollison.com/bookshelf)). Three books which I am currently (re) reading:
- Good to Great, Jim Collins
- The Hard Things About Hard Things, Ben Horowitz
- Actionable Gamification, Yu-Kai Chau 


<br></br>
<br></br>

Have any books you think I should read? [Send me a recommendation!](https://x.com/mithilproof)
