# Bookshelf

### Updated November 2022

<br></br>
<br></br>

I sometimes post books recommendation (inspired by [Patric Collison](https://patrickcollison.com/bookshelf)). Here are some good books which I think are worth reading. 
I enjoy reading others' lists and browsing their bookshelves, so this intended to be a digital version of that.
