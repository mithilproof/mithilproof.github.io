/**
 * Call `flush()` on the current client, if there is one. See {@link Client.flush}.
 *
 * @param timeout Maximum time in ms the client should wait to flush its event queue. Omitting this parameter will cause
 * the client to wait until all events are sent before resolving the promise.
 * @returns A promise which resolves to `true` if the queue successfully drains before the timeout, or `false` if it
 * doesn't (or if there's no client defined).
